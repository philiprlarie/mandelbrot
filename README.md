To play with the program open index.html. It should open in some internet browser (like Chrome).

You can fill out items in the form and submit to draw different images. Be careful with the Width and Height options. Anything greater that 500x500 and you will start noticing significant performance issues. You can crank it up to 1440x900 or something big if you want to get a cool screenshot, but the image might take minutes to render.

The iteration option can cause an increase in rendering time as well. You will need to bump this number up as you zoom in further.

Click the image to move where it is centered. Click while holding shift to zoom in. Click while holding ctrl to zoom out.

Mess around and see what you can find.


Input
bandSplitPercents is an array of floats from 0 to 100. You don't need to include 0 or 100, those get added for you. The bandSplitPercents are only the middle ones. E.g. If there are 3 bands, there are 2 splits.
